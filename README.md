# Capstone Project IV: Full Stack React & Express

## Description 
A full-stack web app using React and Express frameworks. This web app interfaces with the the most popular VCS provider to facilitate a seamless browsing experience (Integrates with the GitHub API). 
More information on the GitHub API can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

## Importance 
This repository is important as the web app will consolidate all the concepts that I have learned about Express, Restful APIs, the Fetch API, React and JavaScript. It includes React and Express testing. It also provides insights to my understanding and comprehension of HTML and CSS fundamentals.
