# Capstone Project IV: Full Stack React & Express

## Description 
A full-stack web app using React and Express frameworks. This web app interfaces with the the most popular VCS
provider to facilitate a seamless browsing experience (Integrates with the GitHub API).

## Importance 
This repository is important as the web app will consolidate all the concepts that I have learned about Express, Restful APIs, the Fetch API, React and JavaScript. It includes React and Express testing. It also provides insights to my understanding and comprehension of HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Game Rules

-> The objective of Hangman is to guess the secret word correctly before you run out of attempts.

-> The secret word is represented by a row of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter in the word.

-> If a player guesses a letter that is in the word or phrase, all instances of that letter are revealed in the display.

-> If a player guesses a letter that is not in the word or phrase, a part of the hangman is drawn.

-> You have 6 attempts.
